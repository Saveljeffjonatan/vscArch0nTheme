# README

## This is the README for extension "arch0n"

I wanted to have something that was colorful but still light on the eyes. I searched for a really long time but never really found the correct color schema. So if you are like me and enjoy light but high contrast colors then this is the theme for you!

Colors being used:

- #367FFF
- #FDE74C
- #F78C6C
- #ABC924

## Installation

1. You need to have ({[bracket-pair-colorizer-2]}) installed.
1. You also need [material-icon-them]
1. I would recommend to also enable: "editor.cursorStyle": "block",
